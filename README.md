# rfind: A high-performance file-finding tool in Rust

rfind is a modern and highly efficient command-line tool designed to search for files and directories on your system. Built from the ground up in Rust, rfind leverages the language's core strengths—speed, safety, and concurrency—to deliver a file search experience that is both faster and more reliable than traditional alternatives.

With rfind, you can quickly locate files by name, filter by file type (e.g., files or directories), and specify permissions for precise searches. By using internal, low-level APIs and a concurrent processing model, rfind avoids the overhead of external binaries and makes full use of modern multi-core processors to traverse your filesystem with exceptional speed.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of Rust's capabilities in building robust, high-performance command-line tools for real-world use cases.
